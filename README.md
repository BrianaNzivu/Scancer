## 🧠 Powered by Machine Learning

Scancer integrates the strengths of multiple models to ensure accuracy:

- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** – Analyzes ultrasound images to detect patterns indicative of cancer.
- **ResNet** – Deep residual learning for enhanced image classification performance.
- **Logistic Regression** – Provides statistical analysis on clinical measurements.
- **Decision Tree** – Offers a transparent and interpretable classification process.

These models work in tandem to analyze data, increasing diagnostic confidence through ensemble learning.
